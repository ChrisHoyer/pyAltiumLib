Contributing and Coverage 
**************************

Contributing to pyAltiumLib
===========================

This is a personal open source project that has been developed in my spare time. Any kind of contribution, suggestion, feedback or bug report is very welcome.

If you want to suggest improvements, report a bug or any other problem, please use the `issue report page and provide <https://github.com/ChrisHoyer/pyAltiumLib/issues>`__ all the information and files needed to reproduce the problem.

The code is available in `this repository <https://github.com/ChrisHoyer/pyAltiumLib>`__ on GitHub. Feel free, to submit improvements or bug fixes using forks and pull requests.


File Format Coverage
=======================

Currently, the format is not completely supported, some aspects are not fully implemented. Not all containers or records are known yet, so this list and the associated documentation may be incomplete.

The coverage of containers of the Altium library file format is shown below:
